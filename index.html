<p><h1>What the hell is a Web Page?</h1>
A web page is a text document written in a language called <b>HTML</b>. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them. Steve explains major pieces of the web in <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48329854/m-48480496">this video</a>

<p><h2>How Coding Works</h2>
Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.
</p>

<p><h3>Computers are <em>Stupid</em></h3> 
Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct <em>"syntax"</em>).

<h1>HTML tags</h1>
<p><b><strong>Tag</strong></b>: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag, Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag.
</p>
<p></p><b><strong>Element</strong></b>: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
</p>
<p>
  <b><strong>Attribute</strong></b>: This is a property of an HTML element.
